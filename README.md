# NUCLEUS TEST AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK


This README will walk you through the process of setting up the nucleus automation project.


## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

**Node.js**: It's recommended to install Node.js using Node Version Manager (NVM), as this allows you to switch between different Node versions easily. For this project, you should use Node.js versions between 14 and 18, as these are the versions compatible with Appium 2.

**Appium 2**: Appium is an open-source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid, and mobile web apps.

## Installing Node.js through NVM
Follow the instructions on the [NVM GitHub page](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node Version Manager.
In the case of MacOs users, it is also possible to use [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nvm) to install it.

Once NVM is installed, you can install Node.js by running:
```bash
nvm install <version>

```
Replace <version> with the version number between 14 and 18.

```bash
npm install
```



### After Installation:
It will be required to run the post-installation script that is in the package.json
